SGF4J
=====

I've been doing some serious [yak shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving). Instead of solving [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) problems to improve my game I've been writing a [SGF](http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/) viewer to make it easier to go through my problem files.

As a side result of that viewer (which I haven't put up yet anywhere) I had to do some SGF parsing. Hence this project. You can use this library to parse SGF files and then actually play it out on a virtual board. The library is very simple and probably won't fit your needs but I think it is a better start than the projects I checked out before rolling my own.
